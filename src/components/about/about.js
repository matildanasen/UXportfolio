        <p>
          I am a student at Ume√• University, studying Master of Science in
          Engineering in Interaction Technology and design. In the spring of
          2021, I will do my master thesis to graduate in June.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          My main area of interest in Interaction Technology and design is user
          experience. My studies have given me a lot of knowledge in different
          areas, such as programming where I learned several programming
          languages such as C, java, javascript, python, C# and more. Also
          learning different programs for like Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Postman,
          React, Flutter and others like Matlab and Minitab, used in my studies
          for mathematics. Have also been doing courses with databases and
          different types of applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have also read some courses in art history, literature, visual arts
          and economics that have contributed a breadth and creativity to my
          education. Which I have greatly appreciated. It is this breadth of
          knowledge and with a depth in technology that makes the core of my
          engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my studies I have also learned a lot about ux, design processes and
          usability testing. Where I used various programs such as Adobe XD,
          Figma, Adobe Photoshop and more. It is this part of my education that is
          closest to my heart. And which I hope to be able to develop in and
          work with in the near future.{" "}
